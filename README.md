# Webclient

A browser-based game client written with TypeScript, React, and ThreeJS.

This project is very much an early work-in-progress and is not able to be used to log into the game at this time. Please use the existing [Java Game Client](https://github.com/runejs/refactored-client-435) to log into the [RuneJS game server](https://github.com/runejs/server).
